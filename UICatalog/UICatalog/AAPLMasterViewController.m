// When a segue from the AAPLMasterViewController's table view is triggered, we want to ensure that the current detail view controller's
// "More" bar button item is correctly transferred to the destination detail view controller's navigation item. We are only concerned about
// this change when the application is in portrait mode since this is the only time that the "More" bar button item will be visible.

        // However, the "More" bar button item is only visible if the detail view controller's root view controller is
        // visible (otherwise there would be a "Back" bar button item). We can then query the old detail view controller's top view
        // controller for the current "More" bar button item.
