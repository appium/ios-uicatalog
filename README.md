## ios-uicatalog

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/appium/ios-uicatalog.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

A simple test application for iOS, used by [Appium](https://github.com/appium/appium)
for certain tests. For more information, see the [docs]('./uicatalog-info.md').

### Building

`npm install` will build the app for a simulator. If you want also to build for
a real device, set the environment variable `IOS_REAL_DEVICE` or `REAL_DEVICE`
to a truthy value.

```
REAL_DEVICE=1 npm install
```

If any special build information is needed, the `XCCONFIG_FILE` environment
variable can be set to the path to an `xcconfig` file.

## Watch

```
npm run watch
```

## Test

```
npm test
```
